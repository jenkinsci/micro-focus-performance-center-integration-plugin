Using this plugin, you can:
- Upload LoadRunner and JMeter scripts from a GitHub repository or a GitLab project to a project on a LoadRunner Enterprise server.
- Create LoadRunner Enterprise tests from a YAML file.
- Run a LoadRunner Enterprise test from its ID or create it from YAML file or YAML syntax and then run it.

There is another plugin for running performance tests using LoadRunner Enterprise. For details, see [Micro Focus Application Automation Tools](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Micro+Focus+Application+Automation+Tools) - [LoadRunner Enterprise Integration](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Performance+Center+Integration).

This plugin is open source. If you identify any issues or want to submit enhancement requests, please use JIRA. The component for this plugin is the micro-focus-performance-center-integration component. Your feedback and involvement will allow us to stabilize and enhance the capabilities of the plugin. The latest, early access, beta versions of this plugin are available here. 
## Versions

### Version 1.0.0
This version provides the following enhancements:

**Git synchronization**

- Ability to synchronize LoadRunner Enterprise with Git by uploading LoadRunner and JMeter scripts stored in a Git repository to a LoadRunner Enterprise project.

### Version 1.1.0
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Git Synchronization: ability to create a LoadRunner Enterprise test from YAML files stored in Git.
- Test Execution: Ability to create a test (from YAML file or from YAML content) before running it.

### Version 1.1.1
Fixed a defect relating to a tech preview feature (REST API usage of LoadGenerator and Controller for dynamic provision).

### Version 1.1.2
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Network Virtualization Insights report is published in the Build's logs (this works with LoadRunner Enterprise but requires a hotfix in all Performance Center versions).
- Rebranded the product name from "Performance Center" to "LoadRunner Enterprise", "PC" to "LRE" and "My PC" to "LoadRunner Enterprise Application".

### Downloads
You can download the plugin from this link:

- [Version 1.1.0](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/micro-focus-performance-center-integration/1.1.0/micro-focus-performance-center-integration-1.1.0.hpi).
- [Version 1.1.1](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/micro-focus-performance-center-integration/1.1.1/micro-focus-performance-center-integration-1.1.1.hpi).
- [Version 1.1.2](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/micro-focus-performance-center-integration/1.1.2/micro-focus-performance-center-integration-1.1.2.hpi).

## Prerequisites
1. Java version 8 or higher. To verify your Java version, go to http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp.
2. LoadRunner Enterprise server.
3. Git Repository on GitHub or GitLab server.
4. Jenkins versions: This plugin supports only the latest five LTS versions of Jenkins (currently 2.60.3). This is a result of the Jenkins policy to no longer support older update centers. Jenkins 2.54 and higher requires you to have Java 8 installed on the machine.
5. Content Security Policy: Starting with version 1.641 (or 1.625.3), Jenkins introduced the Content-Security-Policy header. This causes some of the integration links, such as links to reports, to become inoperable. For details, see [Configuring Content Security Policy](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy) and [Jenkins Security Advisory](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2015-12-09/) . For suggested workarounds until the issue is resolved, see [Content Security Policy Header](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Micro+Focus+Application+Automation+Tools#MicroFocusApplicationAutomationTools-ContentSecurityPolicyHeader).
6. LoadRunner Enterprise projects with Version Control enabled are not supported.

## Support for Pipelines

##### **Generate pipeline code**

1.  To set up a pipeline test job for your Micro Focus testing tool:  
    1.  From Jenkins Dashboard, click **New Job** or select an existing
        one.
    2.  On the page that opens, enter a job name (for a new job),
        click **Build a Pipeline project**, and click **OK**.
    3.  In the Project Configuration page, scroll down to the Pipeline
        section.
    4.  Enter the **stage** and **node** arguments into
        the **Script** area. For example, 
        
        ```
        stage('RunTestFromFS'){ // The stage name
        node('Test'){ //  The name of the node in which to run the test.
        ```
        
2.  Prepare the code for your testing tool:
    1.  Click the **Pipeline Syntax** link.
    2.  In the Snippet Generator drop down, select the desired step, for
        example, ****pcGitBuild: Synchronize Performance Center with
        Git****.
    3.  Fill in the fields as required. Fields marked in red are
        mandatory. **Note:** For fields that take multiple values, such
        as in the **Tests** field, separate multiple entries with a line
        break.
    4.  Click **Generate Pipeline Script**. Copy the code to the
        clipboard.
3.  Return to the Project Configuration page, and paste the generated
    Groovy script into the **Script** field in the Pipeline section.
4.  Repeat the above steps to add other commands to your script.
5.  Save the script and run or schedule the job as you would with any
    standard Jenkins job.
