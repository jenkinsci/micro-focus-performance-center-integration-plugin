Using this plugin, you can:
- Upload performance scripts from a GitHub repository or a GitLab project to a project.
- Create performance tests from a YAML file.
- Run a performance test from its ID, or create it from a YAML file or YAML syntax and then run it.

There is a separate plugin for running performance tests using OpenText Enterprise Performance Engineering. For details, see [OpenText Application Automation Tools](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Micro+Focus+Application+Automation+Tools) - [OpenText Enterprise Performance Engineering Integration](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Performance+Center+Integration).

**Submit issues and feedback through [JIRA](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36795?jql=project%20%3D%20JENKINS%20AND%20component%20%3D%20micro-focus-performance-center-integration)**

This plugin is open source. If you identify any issues or want to submit enhancement requests, please use JIRA. The component for this plugin is the micro-focus-performance-center-integration component. Your feedback and involvement will allow us to stabilize and enhance the capabilities of the plugin. The latest, early access, beta versions of this plugin are available here. 
## Versions

### Version 1.0.0
This version provides the following enhancements:

**Git synchronization**

- Ability to synchronize OpenText Enterprise Performance Engineering with Git by uploading performance scripts stored in a Git repository to a project.

### Version 1.1.0
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Git Synchronization: Ability to create a performance test from YAML files stored in Git.
- Test Execution: Ability to create a test (from a YAML file or YAML content) before running it.

### Version 1.1.1
Fixed a defect relating to a tech preview feature (REST API usage of Load Generator and Controller for dynamic provisioning).

### Version 1.1.2
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Network Virtualization Insights report is published in the Build's logs.
- Rebranded the product name from "Performance Center" to "LoadRunner Enterprise", "PC" to "LRE", and "My PC" to "LoadRunner Enterprise Application".

### Version 1.1.3
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Fix for Java 11.
- Connect to the server with a tenant.

### Version 1.1.4
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Fix for pipeline build (FreeStyle project works fine): 
  - problem: While the first build passes and synchronizes everything, subsequent builds, supposed to only synchronize the changes in the Git repository, cannot calculate the difference and fail.
  - Resolution: All pipeline builds now behave as if they are the first build and will synchronize everything.
- Added support for DevWeb protocol: A folder containing both the "main.js" and "rts.yml" files is considered a performance script.
- Added support for Gatling scripts: A folder containing a file with ".scala" for extension is considered a performance script.
- Additional rebranding (changing "Performance Center" to "LoadRunner Enterprise" in the build logs).

### Version 1.1.5
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Ability to use a token API (access key) associated with a user for authentication.
- Added support for Selenium script. A folder containing a file with ".java" extension in which the expression "import org.openqa.selenium" is detected will be considered performance script.
- Fixed a defect caused by the plugin trying to validate a Linux OS system path according to Windows OS criteria and vice versa, when the Jenkins server and the remote agent are on a different OS type.

### Version 1.1.6
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Rebranding from Micro Focus to OpenText.
- Possibility to associate a YAML defined test to a trend report.
- Possibility to search for a timeslot defined for performance test to execute and use it.
- Possibility to add a wait time between generation of the trend report and the download of the trend report to the build artifact.
- Timeslot duration can be parametrized via two parameters (Hours and Minutes).

### Version 1.1.7
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Removing unused dependency.

### Version 1.1.8
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Rebranding product name.
- Hiding confusing properties that remained for backward compatibility with unsupported old versions.
- Updating different dependency components for security compliance.
- New requirement: Jenkins 2.462.3 and above (requires java 17 or 21).

### Version 1.1.9
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Updating different dependency components for security compliance.
- Test creation from YAML file should be faster when using path to referring to script in groups.

## Prerequisites
1. Jenkins 2.462.3 and above (and consequently Java version 17 or 21). To verify your Java version, go to http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp.
2. OpenText Enterprise Performance Engineering server.
3. Git Repository on GitHub or GitLab server.
4. Jenkins versions: This plugin supports only the latest five LTS versions of Jenkins (currently, the latest is 2.479.3). This is a result of the Jenkins policy to no longer support older update centers. From Jenkins 2.462.3, Java 17 or 21 is required.
5. Content Security Policy: Starting with version 1.641 (or 1.625.3), Jenkins introduced the Content-Security-Policy header. This causes some of the integration links, such as links to reports, to become inoperable. For details, see [Configuring Content Security Policy](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy) and [Jenkins Security Advisory](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2015-12-09/) . For suggested workarounds until the issue is resolved, see [Content Security Policy Header](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Micro+Focus+Application+Automation+Tools#MicroFocusApplicationAutomationTools-ContentSecurityPolicyHeader).
